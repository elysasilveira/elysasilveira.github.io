<p>I am currently a high school math teacher making a career change. I have a BS in Bioengineering and MS in Mechanical Engineering. My dream is to use my skills in math/science/engineering to somehow do my part in making the world a better place. I love solving problems and am exciting to enhance my skills in one of the best problem solving tools available. </p>
