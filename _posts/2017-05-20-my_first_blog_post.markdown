Here I am, three weeks into the Full Stack Web Developer Program and I couldn't be happier that I decided to do this. I've loved the content and struggling through problems. My educational background is in bioengineering/mechanical engineering so I've had some coding experience in Python, LabView, and Matlab, but am excitied to be expanding my knowledge and get more tools in my toolbox. After completing the HTML and CSS portion I don't think I will ever look at a website the same way, I find myself thinking about how and why different websites are layed out and work a particular way. Recently I've really been trying to think more about and experiment with rspec and pry making sure my code is working how I want it to and having an efficient way to troubleshoot when it isnt.
